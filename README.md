# Weatherize
## The weather app

This is the weather app (Beta version, work in progress) builty based on my own [project](https://lukowski.io/weatherize.html).

#### Tech stack:
* React
* Create React App
* Recharts
* Custom CSS styling

Data source: a free version of the [Open Weather API.](https://openweathermap.org/api)

Currently, the usersis able to see the current weather for their  location, as well as the forecast for the next 48 hours and 8 days. Both forecasts come  with the data visualisation.

The locations, currently described as 'favorites' are hard-coded. But I am planning to implement authentication, therefore the users will be able to create account and save their own favorite locations.

npm start - run client server
npm run build, npm run deploy - deploy to gh-pages
